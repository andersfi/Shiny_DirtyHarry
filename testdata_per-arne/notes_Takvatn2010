# notes on gill-net efforth

You need to tell the computer what gill-nets have been used in order to calculate efforth. This information must be specified in it's own table since there likely is many gill-nets not catching any fish, and hence never gets listed in the occurrence table (Fiskedata). Each gill-net constitute an own sampling event in the event table (Garninnsats). 

In this case we assume that the bottom nets in the occurrence table (Fiskedata) is numbered BGO1 to BGO[max number of bottom gillnets] (or FGO as prefix for floating nets). The other nets used (standard gillnets SG, with only one mesh size) is assumed named SG[mesh-size] or just named with mesh-size. The mapping table for samplingProtocol (contains in this instance gill-net type used and secchi/temperature methods) is constructured using unique values for gill-net type in the occurrence table (Fiskedata), but with adding gillnets not occurring there (i.e. those not catching any fish). However, the input data have been sligthly cleaned upon input in order to make life easier when setting up the event table (garninnsats). 

Note that I here have put both Garninnsats and temperature data in one table by just pasting in the temperatures after gill-nets. It could be placed in two tables, but this would create a bit more mess and these to potential two event tables (Garninnsats and temperature in this instance) actually have exactly the same basic data entry - the location, the data, the method (gillnet-type or method for temperature / secchi disk), eventual comments. The only thing that comes into addition is the temperature and secchi disk measurments. 

# log changing input file for testdata
1. Deleted all fiskedata (events) for which no efforth information was given - I assusme this was lacking just because this was a quick and dirty test file. If efforth data is lacking this is offcource not a problem either, but one have to treat the data a bit differently. This is set up as an example of a dataset with efforth data. 

2. Data need to be clean: e.g. date column must contain only dates and not random text strings, numeric columns must contain numbers and nothing else etc..
